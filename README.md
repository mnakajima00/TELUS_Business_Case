# TELUS Business Case (Maiku Nakajima)
> Project made with MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express JS, React JS, Node JS). 

## Thought Process
1. Use an external react component [react-jsonschema-form](https://react-jsonschema-form.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), which allows me to build a HTML form from a json schema. We could then save the json into the database so that we can edit and publish the form at anytime.

**The problem**: Learning how to use this third party component will take more time than I have.

2. Making a semi dynamic form builder with just React and the backend that will allow us to edit forms and publish them.
